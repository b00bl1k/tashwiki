Title: Welcome to TashWiki!

**TashWiki** is a simple, wiki-like static site generator. Think of it as a way
to build your own digital garden, a personal wiki, or just a place to keep and
share your notes.

## How it works

- You write your content in plain Markdown.
- TashWiki understands some extra Markdown extensions, like wikilinks
  (`[[Page Name]]`), so you can connect pages together just like in a real wiki.
- Your pages are rendered with the Jinja2 template engine, which makes it easy
  to customize how your site looks.

## Organizing your wiki

Pages can be grouped into categories, so you don't end up with a messy pile of
notes. Categories are optional, but they make it easier to navigate your wiki
once it grows.

## Why TashWiki?

- No database needed &mdash; just Markdown files.
- Easy to publish &mdash; the result is a static site you can host anywhere.
- Good for both small personal wikis and larger digital gardens.
